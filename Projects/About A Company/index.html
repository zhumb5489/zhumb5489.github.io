  <h1> Welcome to Next-Level Sabers</h1>
  <p><strong>Next-Level Sabers</strong> is a icon in the saber community. We have a wide range of
    both replica and custom sabers that will make any STAR-WARS fan's collection
    Next-Level! All our sabers come with smooth-swing and flash on clash blades,with the
    option to upgrade to higher sound chips and neopixel blades.</p>
  <h1> What is a neopixel blade?</h1>
  <p><strong>Neopixel</strong> blades are some of the most cutting edge saber technology on the
    market.Instead of a light at the bottom of the saber creating the entire
    color of the blade, a neopixel has led lights throughout the blade giving
    the user more control over how the blade looks,and allowing the blade to activate
    in unique ways. This creates a lightsaber experience that is more movie accurate
    and gives the saber a more realistic activation. </p>
  <h1> Here is a video showing what a Neopixel blade looks like in action:</h1>
